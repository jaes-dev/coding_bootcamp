# learn_cpp

## library_basics
This is a basic C++ project containing a few concepts. I've started it with the User class and the skeleton for the terminal application.
To the best of your ability and however you see fit, complete whatever you can. You may change my code.
I've included quite a few comments to try explain certain concepts and ideas. Obviously you can ask me for further explanations or help.

Once we have the basic structure down, I'll help you add SQLite as a database and then QT for a GUI. 

Required Programs:
- MingW
- CMake
- Visual Studio Code, ideally with the C/C++ and Live Share extensions

### How to run on Windows (via terminal [Ctrl+Shift+~ in VS Code])
```
1. mkdir build && cd build
2. cmake && make
3. ./LibraryTool.exe

You may optionally combine steps 2 & 3: "cmake && make && ./LibraryTool.exe"
```

## Pointers
This directory has a basic use of a pointer and reference to illustrate how they work and why you'd need them. Compile the same way as **library_basics**

## puzzles
You can use <a href="https://leetcode.com">leetcode</a> to do random coding puzzles. These are usually obtained from interviews at overseas (mostly American) companies. They're kinda fun and make you think sometimes, but they aren't necessary. Some prove to be a decent test of common data structures and algorithms.
